## What is Lovable AI?

**Lovable AI** is a full-stack AI application development platform that generates **real, production-ready source code** from natural-language prompts.

Unlike traditional **no-code** or **low-code** tools, Lovable focuses on creating **fully editable codebases**, not visual blocks—allowing you to retain **full ownership and flexibility**.

When you describe your idea (for example: *“Build a CRM with deals, contacts, and activity logs”*), Lovable automatically generates:

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite  
- **Backend & API:** Supabase (database, authentication, and storage)  
- **Routing and project structure**  
- **Live preview environment**  
- **Editable source code** with direct GitHub sync support  

Because Lovable exports a real codebase, it is especially popular among developers who want to **skip boilerplate setup** without being locked into a no-code ecosystem.
