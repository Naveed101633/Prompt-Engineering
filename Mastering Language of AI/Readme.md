## Intro  
Prompt engineering is about writing clear instructions that help AI models respond the way you want. It’s a simple but powerful skill anyone can learn—no coding required.

## What It Is & Why It Matters  
Prompt engineering is the practice of guiding large language models (LLMs) through well-designed prompts. In short: it’s learning how to talk to AI effectively.

**Why it matters:**  
- Better prompts = better results  
- Helps you understand model strengths and limits  
- Useful for research, development, and everyday work  
- Boosts productivity across many fields  
- Improves quickly with practice  

Researchers use it to improve safety and reasoning.  
Developers use it to build reliable AI features.  
Anyone can use it to get clearer, faster answers.
