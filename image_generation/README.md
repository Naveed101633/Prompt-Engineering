# 🎨 My Crazy Realistic Prompt Collection
It’s not a course. It’s not a deep dive. It’s simply a way for you to get the exact prompts behind the images you’ve seen on my feed, so you can study how I build scenes, how I phrase direction, and how I control the look.

## 👀 Why this handbook exists
Most creators struggle because they only see the final image—not the structure, intention, or setup. Here, I share the actual prompts from the carousel examples exactly as I use them.  

**By Example — with Real Prompts and Outputs**  

Prompt at [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)  

- **Google Nano Banana** (like MidJourney, DALL·E, or Stable Diffusion, Seemdream) responds to highly descriptive prompts. The more structured, visual, and contextual your input, the closer the output matches your intent.

## Core Principles
1. Specificity Over Generality
Vague: "a nice portrait"
Better: "hyper-realistic studio portrait with professional lighting"

3. Visual Hierarchy
- Start with the main subject
- Add environment/background
- Specify lighting and mood
- Include technical details

4. Professional Photography Language
- Use camera terminology (85mm lens, f/1.4, shallow depth of field)
- Reference lighting setups (Rembrandt lighting, studio lighting)
- Mention photography styles (editorial, cinematic, fine art)
- Anatomy of Effective Prompts
- A well-structured prompt typically includes:

## Subject Description (who/what)
- Pose/Action (body language, positioning)
- Environment (background, setting)
- Lighting (type, direction, mood)
- Style (aesthetic, genre)
- Technical Specifications (camera settings, composition)
- Mood/Atmosphere (emotional tone)

### 1️⃣ Quiet Landscape 🌅
**Reference Image:** `uploaded_face.jpg`
_A surreal cinematic scene of a man in a black tuxedo sitting calmly on the
  armrest of a beige couch that is burning in an open grassy field. Thick smoke
  rising, glowing orange flames consuming the seat cushions. Soft dusk sky with
  pastel lavender and peach tones, distant rugged hills in the background.
  Wide, quiet landscape, melancholic mood, gentle twilight light, grainy 35mm
  film texture, emotional stillness, poetic surrealism –soft focus –film grain
  –pastel horizon._

**2️⃣ Aesthetic Library 📚**
Reference Image: uploaded_face.jpg

 _Convert this image into a fine black and white photograph of a handsome young
  man (take reference face from the uploaded image) with dark hair, his head
  tilted back in a moment of intense creative thought or ecstasy. He is wearing
  an open, loose white collared shirt, standing in a dimly lit study filled with
  stacks of books and papers. The image is captured with a slow shutter speed,
  creating dramatic horizontal motion blur that streaks the background and the
  edges of his form._

**3️⃣ Fish-eye Portrait 📸**

_Create an ultra-wide fish-eye editorial portrait of a woman in a bright
  outdoor parking lot under a vivid blue sky with scattered clouds. Use an
  extreme low-angle shot from ground level, making the character appear
  oversized and dynamic. She is squatting on a yellow parking bumper, reaching
  toward the camera with a pair of oversized silver sunglasses, creating a
  dramatic forced-perspective effect. Outfit: sporty mini-dress or tank top,
  soft pastel knee-high socks, and chunky silver running sneakers with glossy
  highlights. Hair slightly messy and curly, lit by strong daylight._

**4️⃣ Snowy Desert ❄️**

_A hyper-realistic night-time iPhone photo with gritty, harsh direct flash.
  The main character stands in the foreground, calm and detached, hit hard by
  on-camera flash that blows highlights on skin and fabric and drops the
  background into deep shadow. They wear an open oversized fur coat, revealing
  luxurious red underwear. Expression and pose: she winks, lips puckered, both
  hands raised near chest level in a playful “OK” finger gesture. Flirtatious,
  ironic, unserious — reacting to the absurdity rather than the danger.
  Background barely lit: snowy desert, pyramids fading into darkness. In the far
  distance, a small private jet is severely wrecked against a pyramid — nose
  buried in stone, fuselage torn, debris scattered, heavy smoke drifting through
  the cold night air. Uneven exposure, visible grain, slight motion blur.
  Feels accidental, dirty, paparazzi-like — raw, brutal, real._

**5️⃣ Ice Cave 🧊**

_A chaotic, flash-lit winter scene set inside a real, lived-in igloo in the
  Yakut Arctic, blending dark humor with raw, rebellious energy. Use the
  attached portrait as the exact facial reference and preserve the face with
  100% accuracy — no changes to facial structure, proportions, expression,
  skin texture, age, or identity. The face must remain perfectly identical,
  ultra-sharp, and fully photorealistic. The main character sits slouched at a
  low improvised table inside the igloo, surrounded by thick fur blankets,
  carved ice walls, simple wooden objects, thermoses, and everyday household
  items adapted for extreme cold. The space feels genuinely inhabited, not
  stylized — practical, worn, and warm despite the frozen surroundings.
  Behind her, a white Porsche 911 GT3 RS has crashed through the ice wall of the
  igloo, shattering ice blocks and snow inward. Cracked ice, frozen debris, and
  powdery snow scatter across the floor. The car’s metallic body and glowing
  red taillights violently contrast with the white-blue ice interior and
  subzero environment. She wears an oversized patterned knit sweater, black
  tights, heavy winter socks, and a red Santa hat tilted casually on her head.
  One leg rests on the table, elbow on knee, chin leaning into her hand. Her
  expression is bored, unimpressed, and defiant — as if nothing about the chaos
  surprises her anymore. Outside the broken igloo walls, the endless frozen
  Yakut landscape stretches into darkness, with extreme cold visible in the
  air. Harsh on-camera flash freezes every detail — ice texture, fabric fibers,
  frost, and dust — creating gritty realism with slight grain and imperfect
  exposure. Ironic holiday mood, cultural contrast, cinematic mess,
  underground fashion editorial energy. Face must remain unchanged and
  100% preserved. —ar 4:5 —direct flash —grainy film —dark festive chaos

**6️⃣ Arctic Snowfield ❄️✈️**
 
_A gritty night-time winter photograph in a vast, empty Arctic snowfield.
  Endless frozen terrain, compacted snow and solid ice, absolute cold and
  silence. A Northrop B-2 Spirit after a catastrophic impact dominates the
  background. The bomber slammed nose-first deep into snow and ice — the entire
  front section is completely buried. Thick ice has already formed over the
  impact area, crawling up the fuselage. One wing is crushed and buried, the
  other is lifted into the air, frozen mid-position. The aircraft is pitched
  steeply downward, locked in place, entombed by ice and snow. No fire, no
  smoke — only frozen aftermath. The main character stands close to the camera
  in the foreground, caught mid-step or mid-turn. A harsh direct on-camera
  flash fully lights the face and upper body, while the aircraft fades into
  darkness and snow haze behind. Snow particles and ice dust are frozen
  mid-air by the flash. Heavy grain, uneven exposure, imperfect handheld
  framing. The face must remain 100% identical to the uploaded portrait —
  exact facial structure, proportions, skin texture. No beautification, no
  stylization. The scene should feel accidental, cold, and final — a massive
  aircraft already becoming part of the Arctic landscape._
